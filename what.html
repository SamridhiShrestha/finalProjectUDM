                <h2> What Is Universal Design?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Universal Design (UD) is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it.

                <h2> Seven Principles of Universal Design</h2>

                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 1: Equitable Use</summary>
                    <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
                    <p>Example: Designing an ATM with controls at varying heights to accommodate users of different heights or abilities.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 2: Flexibility in Use</summary>
                    <p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</p>
                    <p>Example: Providing adjustable desks or tables that can be used by both standing and seated individuals.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use</summary>
                    <p>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</p>
                    <p>Example: Designing smartphones with clear and easy-to-understand icons for various functions, making them intuitive for all users.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 4: Perceptible Information</summary>
                    <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.</p>

                    <p>Example: Installing visual and auditory signals at pedestrian crossings to assist both visually impaired and sighted individuals.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 5: Tolerance for Error</summary>
                    <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</p>

                    <p>Example: Creating software with warning messages and confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletion of important data..</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 6: Low Physical Effort</summary>
                    <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</p>

                    <p>Example: Installing automatic doors in public buildings, allowing easy access for everyone, including those with mobility challenges.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</summary>
                    <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.</p>

                    <p>Example: Designing parking spaces with additional space for wheelchair users to enter and exit vehicles comfortably.</p>
                </details>

                    <h2>Norman's Design Principles</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another set of general design principles that can be applied to make your website intuitive for all users is Donald Norman's design principles. Norman's concepts are useful to keep in mind for designing anything, and can help you to begin thinking like a designer, but some definitions must be extended for users who don't have certain sensory capabilities. 
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <caption>Norman's Design Principles</caption>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                        </thead>
                        <tbody>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Feedback</td>
                                <td>Users should receive clear and immediate feedback after taking an action. For example, when a button is clicked, it should provide visual or auditory feedback, such as a color change or a sound, confirming the action.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Visibility</td>
                                <td>The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to understand how to use them without confusion. For instance, buttons should clearly look clickable, indicating their function, like a raised or highlighted appearance.</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Mapping</td>
                                <td>The relationship between controls and their effects should be clear and understandable. For example, a remote control should have buttons that align with the functions they control on the TV.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Consistency</td>
                                <td>Similar elements should be used in similar ways throughout the design. Consistent placement of navigation elements or buttons across webpages in a website maintains familiarity for users.</td>
                            </tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Constraints</td>
                                <td>Implementing constraints prevents users from making errors. A physical example is a USB connector that only fits in one way, preventing incorrect insertion.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Affordance</td>
                                <td>An object's design should imply its function or use. For instance, a handle on a door affords pulling, and a button affords pressing. Text boxes on a website imply that users can input information.</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
