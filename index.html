                <p>
                    Hello my name is Samridhi Shrestha! I am a fourth year computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder with frontend, backend and embedded development experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a computer science student, I'm captivated by frontend engineering and website design. I thrive on the fusion of creativity and technology, shaping seamless user interfaces with code and design principles. Every project is a canvas where I blend innovation and precision to craft visually compelling and user-friendly websites. I'm dedicated to mastering new frameworks, perfecting responsive layouts, and creating impactful digital experiences that exceed expectations. My passion lies in transforming complex ideas into elegant designs that resonate with users, continually striving to redefine the boundaries of frontend development.

                <h2> Why I Advocate For Universal Design</h2>
                <p>
                    As a software engineer, I believe websites should be usable for everyone. That means making sure they're easy to use for people with different abilities. I'm passionate about this because I think technology should include everyone, no matter their situation.                </p>
                <p>
                    I work hard to create websites that anyone can use comfortably. It's not just about following rules; it's about caring for people and making sure they aren't left out. I team up with others to make sure our websites are accessible to everyone. My goal is to make technology a tool that helps everyone, regardless of their abilities                </p>
