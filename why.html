                <h2> Why Should We Apply Universal Design?</h2>
                
                <h3>Inclusivity and Accessibility</h3>
                <p>                    
                    Universal design ensures that websites are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or limitations. By implementing features like screen reader compatibility, easy navigation, and adaptable layouts, websites become usable for people with disabilities, elderly users, or those with different needs.
                </p>

                <h3> Broader Audience Reach</h3>
                <p>                    
                    Making websites universally accessible expands the potential audience. When a website is designed to accommodate diverse users, it becomes more user-friendly for everyone, not just those with specific needs. This broadens the reach and impact of the website.
                </p>

                <h3>Legal and Ethical Responsibility</h3>
                <p>                    
                    There are legal requirements in many countries mandating accessibility for websites, especially for government, educational, or commercial entities. Incorporating universal design ensures compliance with these laws, meeting ethical responsibilities to make digital content available to everyone.
                </p>

                <h3>Enhanced User Experience</h3>
                <p>                    
                    Accessible websites often provide a better user experience for all users. Features designed for accessibility, such as clear navigation and intuitive interfaces, benefit everyone by making websites easier to use and navigate.
                </p>

                <h3>Future-Proofing</h3>
                <p>                    
                    As technology advances, the need for accessible design becomes increasingly important. By implementing universal design principles from the start, websites are better prepared for future innovations and changes in user needs.

                </figure></div>

                <h3>Case Study 1: Target</h3>
                <p>                
                    In 2008, Target faced a class-action lawsuit due to its inaccessible website. Blind customers couldn't access information or make purchases, which led to the lawsuit. Target settled the case for $6 million and agreed to improve website accessibility.
                </p>


                <h3>Case Study 2: Winn-Dixie</h3>
                <p> 
                     In 2017, Winn-Dixie, a grocery chain, lost a lawsuit for not making its website accessible to visually impaired users. The court ruled that the website violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), emphasizing the need for digital accessibility.
                </p> 

                <h3>Case Study 3: Domino's Pizza</h3>
                <p>                
                    Domino's faced a lawsuit from a blind customer in 2019, claiming their website and app were not accessible. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Domino's appeal, allowing the case to proceed. This highlighted the importance of digital accessibility compliance.
                </p>

                <h3>Case Study 4: Netflix</h3>
                <p>
                    While not specifically related to websites, Netflix faced a lawsuit for not providing closed captions for its streaming content, which hindered access for the hearing impaired. The outcome emphasized the importance of providing accessible content across digital platforms.
